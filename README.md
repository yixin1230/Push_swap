## About

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.
```bash

# Compile the mandatory part
make

# Compile the bonus part
make bonus

# To remove objects
make clean

# To remove objects and executable
make fclean
```
